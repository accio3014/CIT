# for loop

# for variable in range(start, end, step):
#     code to loop
# range(start, end, step) where start, end, step are numbers [ ex. range(1, 5, 2) ]
# From start to end-1(end not included), put the increased/decreased value by step into a variable and loop.
# Don't necessarily have to enter the start and step.
# If start is not entered, 0
# If step is not entered, 1
# range(5)          => start and step not entered
# range(0, 5)       => step not entered
# range(0, 5, 1)    => standard

# while

# while(condition) :
#   code...

# Use the above format
# Similar to an if, run code when the codition is True.

# x = 1
# while(x <= 5):
#     print(x)
#     x = x + 1


# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #


# x = 1
# while(x <= 5):
#     print(x)
#     x = x +2

# i = 2
# while(i <= 100):
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 2


# j = 7
# while(j <= 100):
#     print(j)
#     j = j + 7

# infinite loop, break, continue

# infinite loop is only possible while loop.
# while(True):
#   code...

# Use the above format.

# break
# break is a code inside a loop, and the loop(for or while) ends as soon as break is encountered.
